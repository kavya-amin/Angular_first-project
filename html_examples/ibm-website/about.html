            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>IBM originated from the bringing together of
                several companies that worked to automate routine business transactions,
                including the first companies to build punch card based
                data tabulating machines and to build time clocks.
                In 1924 the company changed its name to "International Business Machines."</p>
